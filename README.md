Just a fork of the [main repo](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner), but published with [this](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-runner/pull/127) change so that I can start using this version easily with Travis CI.

Will hopefully be irrelevant shortly after its publish date.
